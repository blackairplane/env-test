# Env-test
####### A simple PHP script to import `.env` file and set as `$_ENV`
This is a very rudimentary script to be improved upon later. Just documenting the idea here.

The `.gitignore` file has to include `*.env` or else the environment variables are worthless

### Sample .env file:
```
APP_ENV=local
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASS=secret
DB_NAME=database
```
